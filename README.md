# Raytracer v2

Decided to mess around and make another raytracer because why not?

## Usage

Install and build the project
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DonIsaac/Raytracerv2
cd Raytracerv2
make
```

Run it

```sh
./raytracer							# Reads/Writes from stdin/stdout
./raytracer output.ppm				# Specify an output file for the rendered image
./raytracer output.ppm input.txt	# Specify an image file and config file
```
